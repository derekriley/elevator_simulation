# Elevator Simulation Tool

This is an elevator control system simulator for testing and evaluation of elevator dispatch algorithms and system performance.  This was generated by Claude Sonnet 4.  

## Prompt
Elevators are part of most modern commercial buildings and have complex control systems that must ensure safety, reliability, performance, and maintainability. To determine whether the control systems that operate elevators work will meet the expectations of the building owners, simulation can be used to test virtual scenarios. You will be creating an application that will take configuration csv files for a building, set up virtual elevator banks, and allow the user to configure various simulations. The simulations will generate logging data that will be saved to csv files that can be analyzed and allow for scenarios to be adjusted and replayed.  The application should have a GUI and allow the user to interact with the elevator system in an intuitive way to test and evaluate the control system.  The GUI should include buttons to show and allow the user to interact with the buttons inside and outside the elevator.  
Please build a simulation tool as described with Python. If you need to see any more files in whole or part, let me know the terminal commands. I'll run it and paste the results.

## Features

- **Multi-Elevator Simulation**: Simulate multiple elevators with different configurations
- **Interactive GUI**: Intuitive graphical interface with elevator visualizations
- **Configurable Buildings**: Load building configurations from CSV files
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and performance analysis
- **Data Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all simulation events
- **Scenario Testing**: Run predefined simulation scenarios
- **Manual Control**: Interactive buttons for testing specific scenarios

## Architecture

The application is built using SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Elevator, Building, Floor, and Passenger entities
- **Controllers**: Elevator dispatch logic and simulation control
- **GUI**: Tkinter-based user interface with modular components
- **Simulation**: Core simulation engine and logging system
- **Configuration**: CSV-based configuration management

## Quick Start

1. **Run the application**:
   ```python main.py
